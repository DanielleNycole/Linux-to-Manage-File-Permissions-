# Linux-to-Manage-File-Permissions
<h2>Description</h2>

I was tasked with reviewing and setting file and sub directory permissions within Linux for a fictional organization. This was to ensure those that are authorized to access files and directories are the only ones allowed to in order to help secure the system a little more. I examined the current file permissions and adjusted according to the requests of the organization.  <br/>

First, I reviewd the current file permissions in the project directory:  <br/>

<br />


I then used ls -la to show all the files and subdirectories in the project directory what what the permissions were currently set to. <br/>

<br />

The current User Permissions were set as follows:  </br>

Project_k.txt 
  - User = read, write 
  - Group = read, write 
  - Other = read, write 

Project_m.txt
  - User =read, write  
  - Group=read 
  - Other= none 

Project_r.txt
  - User = read, write 
  - Group = read, write  
  - Other = read

Project_t.txt
  - User = read, write
  - Group = read, write
  - Other = read

.project_x.txt
  - User = ead, write
  - Group = write
  - Other = none

Drafts
  - User = read, write, execute
  - Group = execute
  - Other = none

The organization did not want “other” to have write access to any files. Which means Project_k.txt needed to be updated accordingly. I used the command chmod o-w project_k.txt to perform this task

Additionally, .project_x.txt should not have write permissions for anyone, but the user and the group should be able to read the file. I used chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt to remove the writer permissions from the user and the group, and add read permissions for the group.

For the draft subdirectory, only researcher 2 should be allowed to access the drafts directory and its contents. 

So while logged in as researcher2, the user permissions should be set, and the group permissions removed. I used chmod g-x drafts to remove the only permission set for the group and ensure the user was the only one with permissions.

<h2>Summary</h2>

I updated the permissions to match the authorization that was requested by the organization. By listing out the permissions set for all files, including the hidden ones, I was able to assess what permissions were currently set, and what needed to be updated to make sure only those authorized to access the files and directories could do so.
